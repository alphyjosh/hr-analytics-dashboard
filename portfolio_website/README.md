# Alphy Maria Saju - Portfolio Website

This is a simple, modern, single-page portfolio website for Alphy Maria Saju, HR Executive & AI Innovator.

## How to View

1.  Navigate to the `portfolio_website` directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Updating Images

The website uses placeholder images. To update them with your actual images:

1.  **Profile Picture:**
    *   Rename your profile picture (e.g., `B612_20240104_190753_791.jpg`) to `profile.jpg`.
    *   Place it in the `images/` folder, replacing the existing placeholder.

2.  **Project Images:**
    *   For the **HR Certificate Verifier** project: Rename your image to `project1.png` (or `.jpg`, `.jpeg` and update the `<img>` tag in `index.html` accordingly) and place it in the `images/` folder.
    *   For the **AI Recruitment Assistant** project: Rename your image to `project2.png` (or other extension) and place it in the `images/` folder.
    *   For the **HR Analytics Dashboard** project: Rename your image to `project3.png` (or other extension) and place it in the `images/` folder.

    Ensure the image file names and extensions in `index.html` (inside the `<section id="projects">` in the `<img>` tags) match the files you place in the `images/` folder.

    Example `<img>` tag in `index.html`:
    `<img src="images/project1.png" alt="HR Certificate Verifier">`

    If your image is `my_project_image.jpg`, you would change it to:
    `<img src="images/my_project_image.jpg" alt="HR Certificate Verifier">`

## Structure

*   `index.html`: Main HTML file.
*   `css/style.css`: Stylesheet for the website.
*   `js/script.js`: JavaScript for basic interactivity (smooth scroll, current year).
*   `images/`: Folder for all website images.

## Customization

*   **Content:** All text content can be edited directly in `index.html`.
*   **Styling:** Colors, fonts, and layout can be modified in `css/style.css`.
